# My Search 

A simple search engine that uses bangs to search different providers.
Fallback to DuckDuckGo if no custom provider is found.

## Note
This project leverages advanced AI coding assistance tools to systematically explore and evaluate the capabilities, limitations, and overall effectiveness of AI-supported software development. While the main goal is to serve as a research-oriented testbed for AI-assisted coding, a secondary objective is to produce a practically useful and functional result for my everyday use.
